# NaiveAmplificationPrimerGenerator
A program that, given a sequence of DNA, attempts to find a suitable primer for amplification. A particular constraint is that the primer MUST start from the beginning/ending, so the program must be very OK with suboptimal results in a way that most programs would be annoyed about.
